Far away, near a small city-town. Mostly unknown. Bhalla is a village with a couple of hundred people. The sun comes out from the east, sets over to the west. The north is empty, the south has a long history. 

I'll leave the coordinates here but do go check it out yourself.

Coordinates: `33°25'19.4"N 73°25'08.1"E`

Near: Kallar Sayedan, Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan


More information coming soon.
