# Cotton clouds

Unlike that Laurie Anderson song about Superman, the way those planes hover above inside your head as you listen to her voice trick your mind into think you're hearing these unique sounds. 

I was looking at quiet clouds, the white fluff in the sky that was too far from the sun to diminish the brightly warm day. The sky was quiet, I could hear myself breathing, looking up and hearing myself think: what are those, and where do they come from? But just as I thought that, it disappeared from myself until now. 

The clouds in the north did show me the mighty giants in the sky. The mountains that impose upon the miniature beings surrounding them. 

The clouds kept me busy for a bit but as my interested waned from the sky to the ground, the second floor did not look so low to the ground. I ran to the stairs, to the scent that tandoori fires create as the summer heat peaks. There is no description that would fit a day like this perfectly but as the incendiary scent brought warm food and a calming shade under the mango tree, I am recalling one of my first days there.
